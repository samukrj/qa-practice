# QA Practice

This repository contains my manual software testing practice.  
I use it to learn and apply basic QA principles on real web applications.

Currently included:
- functional test cases
- negative test scenarios
- validation of UI elements
- basic checkout and login flow testing

All test cases in this repository were created manually during practice on the demo web application https://www.saucedemo.com/.

Content:
- `test-cases` — collection of manual test cases with preconditions, steps, expected and actual results

More testing exercises and notes may be added gradually as I continue learning.
